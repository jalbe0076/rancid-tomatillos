## Abstract: 
This is a movie rating website that uses the fetch API to display information about a variety of movies. This web app also allows searching movies by title, and filtering by ratings! To gather more information about a particular movie, users are able to click on the movie and view it's details! The app features network requests to access information about movies and utilizes react router to create a multi-page experience.

## Learning Goals:
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
- Implement a robust testing suite using Test Driven Development.
- Make network requests (using fetch API) to create, read, update, and destroy data. 
  - (Apply newly learned concepts including GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE network requests)
- Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. 
- Implement the use of a project board, task delegation tickets, and thorough code reviews.
